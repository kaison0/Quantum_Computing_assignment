    "You may use AI/LLMs as a study aid, but not as a substitute for your own work. Quizzes and problem sets are practice for the midterm and final (70% of your grade), which you must do without any external help. Use AI wisely: ask it to explain, critique, or suggest alternatives — not just to give you the answer. Everything you submit must be something you understand and could explain to a peer without notes.\n",

    "1. File > Save and Export Notebook As > HTML\n",
    "2. Save the HTML file somewhere on your local computer\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Referee picks a vertex $s$ in the graph ($0$, $1$, or $2$) uniformly at random, and sends $s$ to Alice.\n",
    "2. Referee picks a $t$ that is either $s$ or $s+1 \\mod 3$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability each, and then sends $t$ to Bob. \n",
    "3. Alice and Bob have to give colors \"red\" or \"blue\" back to Referee.\n",

    "**b)** In this part you will come up with a _quantum strategy_ for Alice and Bob to beat the LHV (i.e. classical) winning probability. You will code up a strategy by specifying a measurement for Alice that depends on her question $s$, and a measurement for Bob that depends on his question $t$. We assume that Alice and Bob share a single EPR pair $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\Big( \\ket{00} + \\ket{11} \\Big)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in `alice_strategy` for example, you will write based on Alice's question $s$ (which is $0$, $1$ or $2$) what single-qubit gates Alice performs on her half of the EPR pair (which is qubit 0). Afterwards, her qubit is measured in the standard basis to obtain $0$ or $1$ (which correspond to \"red\" or \"blue\"). You will do a similar thing for Bob, except he is supposed to act on his qubit (which is qubit 1).\n",
